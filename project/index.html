                I am a .Net developer with experience in cross platform development and DevOps.
                I have worked heavily around building, automating and deploying large scale applications within the rail

                <p class="resume-body-text">I am currently working as a .net developer in high performance compute.
                    Major duties
                    .Net developer with duties in supporting a major rail ticket vending platform. I was responsible for
                    converting sections of the application to C# and writing API’s to support ticketing. In addition, I
                    was responsible for server management and build out for developer applications such as Jenkins and
                    sonarqube. After moving on from this section of the company, I worked as a full stack developer on a
                    green field hospitality kiosk project that has an angular front end with .Net core backing services,
                    that provide access to approximately 10 pieces of hardware which include payment systems, barcode
                    scanners, receipt printers and several third party API’s. In addition, I was responsible for
                    developing an automated deployment system making use of ansible and chocolatey. After this project
                    was successfully released I moved onto developing 2 new rail API’s used to book train tickets. These
                    API’s made use of .Net 6 docker containers that integrated with an AWS backend using DynamoDb and
                    Amazon Cognito. These products were designed from the ground up to have automated CI/CD pipelines
                    using Azure DevOps to deploy into AWS using terraform. The final project undertaken is a multi-modal
                    transport app making use of AWS Lambda expressions as well as a svelte app used to manage it. All
                    the new projects listed were carried out
                    using modern development techniques such as TDD, Git and agile development practices. Recently I
                    have begun to take on a management and mentorship role for the apprenticeship program teaching C#
                    and other professional skills such as SOLID.</p>

                <p class="resume-body-text">Outside of work my main interests include cooking, computers and sailing. I
                    tend to enjoy cooking as it's a great way to spend a few hours disconnecting from everything else
                    and involves a wide variety of skills and techniques that make it continually interesting. I also
                    find a
                    lot of the skills needed for a software developer overlap with cooking, such as following recipes
                    and the methodicaly nature of the work. It
                    provide a way to share something I enjoy with other people.</p>

            <div class="resume-item">
                <p class="resume-body-text">Sailing is what pushed me to initially pursue a marine engineering degree
                    and I hold a
                    day skipper qualification within this activity. While I can find it a difficult hobby to find time
                    for I still enjoy being on the water. I find sailing tends to provide an engaging group (or solo)
                    activity which helps provide great a great deal of personal fulfillment</p>

            <div class="resume-item">
                <p class="resume-body-text">I have a keen interest in electronics and computing, from building my own
                    desktop to working on a custom router/firewall using pfsense. I find the work relaxing and
                    a good way to keep sharp in the constantly evolving landscape of software development.</p>
