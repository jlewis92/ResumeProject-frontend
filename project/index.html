                    tend to enjoy cooking as it's a great way to spend a few hours disconnecting from everything else
                    and involves a wide variety of skills and techniques that make it continually interesting. I also
                    find a
                    lot of the skills needed for a software developer overlap with cooking, such as following recipes
                    and the methodical nature of the work. It
                    provide a way to share something I enjoy with other people.</p>

                <p class="resume-body-text">Sailing is what pushed me to initially pursue a marine engineering degree
                    and I hold a
                    day skipper qualification within this activity. While I can find it a difficult hobby to find time
                    for I still enjoy being on the water. I find sailing tends to provide an engaging group (or solo)
                    activity which helps provide great a great deal of personal fulfillment</p>
